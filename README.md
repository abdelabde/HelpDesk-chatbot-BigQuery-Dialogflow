# HelpDesk-chatbot-BigQuery-Dialogflow

This repository is about how to build a support helpdesk agent using Dialogflow and BigQuery. #Intro:

Creating a support agent can bring down costs massively for a business. No need to hire an entire team when one well-trained agent can answer multiple requests simultaneously 24/7. This is a huge opportunity for disruption! We're going to train a simple machine learning model for predicting helpdesk response time using BigQuery. Then we'll build a simple chatbot using Dialogflow and learn how to integrate the trained BigQuery ML model into the helpdesk chatbot.

Step 1: A tutorial to create your first support helpdesk agent using Dialogflow and BigQuery.

Step 2: A link for your web-hosted agent, see this tutorial for steps on how to do so.
